Here it is!  Post Emo Emo has arrived! 

I put a lot of work into this one. It started off with a conversation wherein we discussed the definition of 'modern emo' and the idea stuck in my head. What IS modern emo? Well, I hyperfixated and answered that question for you. 

So, what does the Emo landscape look like headed into 2023? Well, kind of amazing TBH. It looks and sounds a LOT like 2010-2011 emo but with SO SO SO much more intersectionality. I love that we have so many more non-male leads and some POC representation in the emo world now! 

One thing I focused on was really allowing my definition of emo to fluctuate. Emo music is different now. We've finally got some decent genre bending tracks that sound amazing (this was attempted years ago and I REALLY didn't care for it). I thought about a few tracks and artists considering if they should be included. 

Really challenge your definition of 'emo'. For example, are we programmed to think that because a track has electric drums and a female singer that it's pop? What if the lyrical content is pretty emo? Does it then count? 

Tough questions and I was only able to come up with a few answers. So this playlist doesn't challenge the definition as much as I'd like, but there's still a few surprises in there - I'm betting you'll like them. We've got everything from heavy post-hardcore, to damn near metal, to slower emo, some screamo, and even some classic sounding poppy emo! All released from 2016 to now. I limited the list to 2016 since it would eliminate most late emo band's second or third albums and keep delineation between 'classic' and 'modern' emo. 

Now lets talk about the ongoing 'Emo Renaissance'. I was subtly aware that we've been seeing a big resurgence of emo lately - both in music releases and in pop culture. The 'Emo's Not Dead' cruise is proof enough of that. 

But it's more than that. This isn't just a bunch of grown as emo kids spinning enough tracks to gain attention - this is coming from the industry itself as well. 2022 saw releases from an impressive array of classic emo bands. Hawthorne Heights checked in with 'Dandelions', Pierce the Veil dropped 'Pass the Nirvana' (the track that kick started this whole thing really), Paramore made 'This is Why' (it's ok), Armor for Sleep, Sleeping with Sirens, Bayside, Silverstein, Simple Plan, The Used, A Day To Remember, Anthony Green, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday, and even My Chemical Romance - all put out at least one new track in 2022 and some of these bands haven't made anything in like 12 years.

And that's just talking OLD bands. There's a shitload of new groups out there making really solid music. RedHook, Stand Atlantic, Meet Me @ The Altar, Hot Milk, First and Forever, Palaye Royale, jxdn, and not to mention the rise of the first 'emo super group' L.S. Dunes - featuring Anthony Green (Saosin, Circa Survive), Travis Stever (Coheed & Cambria), Frank Iero (My Chemical Romance), Tim Payne (Thursday), and Tucker Rule (Thursday).

Emo is back and I couldn't be happier for it. I'll keep working on this, yall just keep listening. 🙂 

Now I've included a few pointers, suggestions, and notes below if you're interested:
-Seriously the new blink track is shit. I personally really like Skiba-era blink so I don't really care for the new sound.
-'Pass the Nirvana' is so ridiculously good. 10/10 total banger
-It's come to my attention the Spotify shuffle algorithm is total shit. So it's possible you'll only hear a certain few tracks over and over if you shuffle.

-Stand out tracks:
Miracle - A Day to Remember
Permanent Rebellion - L.S. Dunes
Kingslayer - Bring Me The Horizon, BABYMETAL
BETTER OFF DEAD - jxdn
Comatose - Coheed & Cambria
Bad Decisions - RedHook
Prayers - Bayside
Bankrupt - Silverstein
Hair Out - Stand Atlantic
